#### How to build the console version:

By default, the project will run in its own window, using
OpenTK. To make it run in a terminal, follow these steps:

1. Open ConsoleForays.sln instead of Forays.sln.
2. Change the first line of the Main method (in Main.cs)
   by uncommenting "Screen.GLMode = false;".
3. Compile in Debug mode! Then run ConsoleForays.exe.
