(Forays into Norrendrin is a roguelike game. Don't know what a
 roguelike is? Visit www.roguebasin.com for more info.)


How to play:

(Forays has in-game help in the form of tutorial tips that pop
 up to explain each new concept the first time you encounter it,
 so feel free to exit Help and jump right in!)


Important commands to remember are [e] to examine and change
your equipment, and [a] to use your consumable items.
If your health drops, press [r] to rest - but only once per
level!


Your torch illuminates your surroundings, but also gives away
your position. If you wish to avoid notice, put away your
torch with [t]. ([t] will also bring it back out again.)


Press Tab to look at your surroundings. (Pressing Escape or
Space will exit most menus and selections.)


If you've learned a spell, you can cast it by pressing [z].


You can view and activate feats from the character screen [c].
(Some feats are activated, while some are entirely passive.)


Try switching to your bow and firing some arrows([e] to switch,
[s] to shoot). You always have access to five different weapons
and three different armors. 


Remember that you don't need to kill every enemy you encounter.
Some enemies - mostly humanoids - can carry consumable items,
though.


When you find stairs, you can walk down them with [>]. (It's a
one-way trip, so don't leave anything behind!)


The full command list can be accessed in-game by pressing [-].
