Tips and advanced topics:

Damage:

Damage values are described as die rolls. For instance, a 2d6
attack will deal damage equal to two dice with six sides each,
added together.



Stealth:

Several factors determine whether you'll be spotted on a given
turn: Your stealth skill, your distance from enemies, whether
you're in darkness or light, and how long you've been within
the sight range of enemies. 

Here's the formula:

Skill * Distance * 10  -  TurnsVisible * 5

The result is your chance to remain unnoticed, in percentage.
(100 and above will always succeed.)
Darkness gives a +2 bonus to stealth skill in this calculation.
Animals and some other foes are harder to sneak past - they use
a 5 instead of a 10 in the formula.

Because of this, you're much more likely to remain unseen
if you stay two or more spaces away. Enemies automatically see
you if you're carrying a light source, or if you're wearing
plate mail and simply standing in the light. Making a noise
while in plain sight will also get you spotted.



Noise volumes:

The volume of a noise is how far away it can be heard. The
sound doesn't pass through solid tiles, but does travel around
corners - basically, wherever you could walk to in that many
steps.

Explosions, alarm traps, and scrolls of thunderclap:  12
Combat:  8 (from both parties)
Collapse spell:  8 (from target)
Words of magic (spells & scrolls):  6
All monster noises (growls, yells, etc.):  6
Items shattering (potions & orbs):  4
Walking on gravel:  3
